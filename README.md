# LoginWithStore

A sample project to illustrate how it's possible to handle complex UI state with a Redux Store based approach.

The code has two variations:
* [A simplified Redux approach that just leverages asynchronous state](https://github.com/andrea-prearo/LoginWithStore/tree/main)
* [A classic Redux implementation using side effects](https://github.com/andrea-prearo/LoginWithStore/tree/side-effects)
